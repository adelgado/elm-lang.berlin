            I've just started this website; clearly not a designer, sorry it
            looks so bland :-) Please take it as am empty canvas and I welcome
            your pull requests in order to improve it and make it ours!

   <footer>
      I've heard I'm legally supposed to have an "Impressum" here, I have no
      idea what that is, I'll look it up and update it as soon as I have it.
